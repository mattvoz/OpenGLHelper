## Project
This is an implementation of a couple useful helper functions for OpenGL

## Windows Compilation
Must have MYSYS installed on your system and make enabled for Mingw other than that i try to provide all the extra required libraries if possible.


## OpenGL 
Column major arrays are stupid :) BUT when constructing a matrix don't forget to put them in it since this is the openGL standard :)
